- This Python script makes use of the Request-HTML library to gather metadata on a video. If the video title doesn't match the previously stored value it will get more data on the video (URL & description) and use this to populate (with the correct layout/tags) and publish a WordPress post with the help of the WordPress XML-RPC API.
